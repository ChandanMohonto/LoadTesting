## 2. Purpose of Load Testing

**Load testing** is essential to assess the performance of a system under normal and peak load conditions. The primary objectives are:

* **Identify system bottlenecks**: Load testing helps detect performance issues such as slow response times and failed transactions during high load.
* **Validate scalability**: It ensures the system can handle increasing traffic or load, such as more users or requests.
* **Ensure reliability and stability**: Load testing confirms that the system can perform consistently under expected and unexpected loads, preventing crashes and downtime.
* **Capacity planning**: It helps understand the system's limits, which aids in future resource allocation for handling peak traffic.

## 3. Different Types of Load Tests

### 3.1 **Smoke Test**

* **Purpose**: Verify that basic functionality works and that the system handles minimal load.
* **Duration**: Short (seconds or minutes).
* **When to Use**: After changes in the system or application code to check for critical issues or breakages.

### 3.2 **Load Test**

* **Purpose**: Assess system performance under expected normal conditions (average load).
* **Duration**: Medium (5-60 minutes).
* **When to Use**: During routine performance checks to ensure the system handles typical usage without significant delays or failures.

### 3.3 **Stress Test**

* **Purpose**: Push the system to its limits by applying loads greater than the expected average, to test how it reacts under extreme conditions.
* **Duration**: Medium (5-60 minutes).
* **When to Use**: To evaluate system robustness and identify how the system performs when under heavy traffic or unexpected spikes.

### 3.4 **Soak Test**

* **Purpose**: Assess system performance over prolonged periods, identifying issues such as memory leaks, resource depletion, or system slowdowns.
* **Duration**: Long (hours).
* **When to Use**: After making changes to the system to evaluate stability and reliability over time.

### 3.5 **Spike Test**

* **Purpose**: Simulate sudden and massive increases in traffic to see how the system performs during quick spikes.
* **Duration**: Short (a few minutes).
* **When to Use**: For systems that may experience seasonal or traffic bursts (e.g., e-commerce websites during sales events).

### 3.6 **Breakpoint Test**

* **Purpose**: Gradually increase the load until the system reaches its capacity limit to find the point of failure.
* **Duration**: Variable, depending on the system.
* **When to Use**: When you need to identify the maximum capacity and failure thresholds of your system.

## 4. Test Scenarios and Calculation Based on Current Service

### Scenario Breakdown:

Based on the current **k6 load test script**, the following scenarios and their respective durations are calculated:

#### **1. Smoke Test**

* **Duration**: 30 seconds
* **Virtual Users (VUs)**: 1

#### **2. Load Test**

* **Duration**: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
* **Virtual Users (VUs)**: 50

#### **3. Stress Test**

* **Duration**: 10 minutes (600 seconds)
* **Virtual Users (VUs)**: Starts at 50 and ramps up to 200.

#### **4. Soak Test**

* **Duration**: 2 hours (7,200 seconds)
* **Virtual Users (VUs)**: 20

#### **5. Spike Test**

* **Duration**: 1 minute (60 seconds)
* **Virtual Users (VUs)**: 100

#### **6. Breakpoint Test**

* **Duration**: 35 minutes (2,100 seconds)
* **Virtual Users (VUs)**: Starts at 10 and ramps up in stages.

### Total Duration Calculation:

To calculate the total time required to complete all scenarios:

* **Smoke Test**: 30 seconds
* **Load Test**: 300 seconds
* **Stress Test**: 600 seconds
* **Soak Test**: 7,200 seconds
* **Spike Test**: 60 seconds
* **Breakpoint Test**: 2,100 seconds

**Total Duration** = 30s + 300s + 600s + 7,200s + 60s + 2,100s = **9,690 seconds** = **2 hours, 41 minutes, and 30 seconds**.

### Key Metrics to Monitor:

* **Response Time**: Track the time it takes to serve requests.
* **Throughput**: The number of requests served per unit of time.
* **Error Rate**: The percentage of requests that fail.

By observing these metrics during your tests, you can gain insights into your system's performance and identify areas for improvement.

| Type       | VUs/Throughput        | Duration                   | When?                                                                                                               |

| Smoke      | Low                   | Short (seconds or minutes) | When the relevant system or application code changes. It checks functional logic, baseline metrics, and deviations. |
| Load       | Average production    | Mid (5-60 minutes)         | Often to check system maintains performance with average use.                                                       |
| Stress     | High (above average)  | Mid (5-60 minutes)         | When system may receive above-average loads to check how it manages.                                                |
| Soak       | Average               | Long (hours)               | After changes to check system under prolonged continuous use.                                                       |
| Spike      | Very high             | Short (a few minutes)      | When the system prepares for seasonal events or receives frequent traffic peaks.                                    |
| Breakpoint | Increases until break | As long as necessary       | A few times to find the upper limits of the system.                                                                 |
